In the virtual prototype the files that we added/modified are:
- in modules the directory performanceCounter contains the verilog files and the tb used to do the profilig counter: counter.v, 
  profileCi.v, profileCi_tb.v.
- in programms/grayscale/src the grayscale.c file has been modified to add the assembly instructions to manage our performance counters.
